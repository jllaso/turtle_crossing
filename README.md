This is a challenge that I implemented without supervision as part of the course '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp'. 
It builds a 'Turtle Crossing' game from scratch and uses 3 classes, one to build the cars that cross the road that our turtle has to cross, another one that creates our player turtle, and
another that keeps track of the level we are at.
